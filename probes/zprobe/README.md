Should just load in arduino dev system, I use 1.0.1. Then load into your ramps based system.

You will need to hook up a microswitch on the hot end or close by.

You also need to set the steps/mm and speed.

This one just probes each corner and tells you the difference in micrometers from 0,0 z.

If it is positive then it is higher, negative it is lower.
