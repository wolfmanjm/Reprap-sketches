These files are sketches which do various probes of a reprap or CNC bed.

The zprobe directory contains a sketch that just probes the z at 4 corners to help level the bed,
setup to work with Ramps1.4

The probe directory has a sketch that probes the z on a 10mm grid, and generates output that can be used to 
create a surface map in Excel or OpenOffice. Currently setup for a GRBL system.
