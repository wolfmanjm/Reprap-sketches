This probes a 10x10mm grid, and the output can be used to generate a surface map in Excel or OpenOffice.

copy paste the output to a file then process that file with the ruby
script csv2xl.rb, then paste the output of that into a spread sheet.

Select the data in the spread sheet and click the charts button and
select surface chart, the rest should just be defaults.

NOTE this is currently setup for the pins used in GRBL, it needs a
littl emodification to work in a Ramps/Marlin environment.

I'll be doing that soon'ish.
